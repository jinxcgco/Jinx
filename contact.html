I am a person who doesn't like having social networks, that's not how I like to
work, I occasionally scroll through 4chan or visit some subreddits, but not more
.

I am almost all the time connected in several IRC channels (but not using "Jinx"
as name) such as #gnu and #fsf, I am also a lot of time online in my XMPP
accounts:

* jinxcgco@chat.sum7.eu
* hermadescgco@chinwag.im

I encourage you to use the _jinxcgco@chat.sum7.eu_ as that is my main account
and I am only like 1 or 2 times a week in the _hermadescgco@chinwag.im_
account.

You can also send me a mail to the following address:

* hermadescgco@disroot.org
