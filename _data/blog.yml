    Today I added two lessons to the hacking course in LibreAcademia and hope I can add two more lessons to the C Course today, lately I haven't feel that productive.

    I also added a very simple contact page [here](/contact), if you want to talk with me.

    I have made a lot of progress in the paths system of the non-free LibreAcademia (yes, the main instance of LibreAcademia is not free-compatible and I hate it).

    Go and check it out [here](https://libreacademia.gq/paths).

    In this website (in the future) will be a completely free-compatible and minimalistic instance of that site.
