    I started working on this page a few hours ago, I have a lot of expectations for this, I want to write about a lot of things.

    I've been using XFCE for a long time, and today, I finally installed dwm again, I love that window manager. I also installed XDM, I love how everything looks now.

    Today I added two lessons to the hacking course in LibreAcademia and hope I can add two more lessons to the C Course today, lately I haven't feel that productive.

    I also added a very simple contact page [here](/contact), if you want to talk with me.

    I have made a lot of progress in the paths system of the non-free LibreAcademia (yes, the main instance of LibreAcademia is not free-compatible and I hate it).

    Go and check it out [here](https://libreacademia.gq/paths).

    In this website (in the future) will be a completely free-compatible and minimalistic instance of that site.

    I will start working in two projects now, [LibreAcademia](https://libreacademia.gq) and **LibreSuite**.

    So far, the LibreSuite development hasn't started yet, I am just thinking how I will do it, I will draw their designs and will start looking for resources first.
    I hope that at the end of this day, I have, at least, started with a very basic thing.

    You will be able to see the LibreSuite's source code, once there is something, [here](https://github.com/JinxCGCO/LibreSuite)

    **Note**: I will stop using GitHub soon, I will move everything to CodeBerg or NotABug, probably.
