# How I do my computing?

**Note**: This is based in the way RMS did it on his
[page](https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html).

## My computer

I use an Asus X441N, which runs a free operating system (Trisquel).

## GNU/Linux distro

I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.

I've been using Debian, Arch and Gentoo based distributions for a long time, I
got used to them. I've also tried Void and Fedora, but didn't like them that
much.

I usually switch between Debian, Arch and Gentoo.

## What I do on my computer

I am almost all the time working on a project, reading a book or watching
videos. I have a lot of books downloaded on my computer, such as the emacs and
gdb manual, some others about programming (NASM, C and Perl) and also some
hacking and politics books.

When I am not working on any project, reading a book or watching videos, I am
hacking my computer, modifying things, testing window managers, opening, reading
, moving and copying files, create little programs in programming languages I am
learning, practise things using my flashcards in Anki, and that sort of things.

## How I use my computer

I don't like using a mouse, that's why the reason of my love for tiling window
managers. I am currently using dwm, I also use ranger as a file manager, emacs
as text editor and lynx for several purposes.

I don't like wasting my time "ricing" my window manager and I also don't care
about how my desktop looks like. I have no wallpaper, it's just a black
background with a gray bar in the top, I don't like beautiful and heavy things
as my computer is not that powerful, I prefer to save as much resources as
possible for my computing.

## How I use the internet

I am so strict about the way I use the internet.

I search thigns using lynx (connected to the tor network), actually, I use lynx
whenever is possible, regretably there are some sites that makes it impossible,
so when I need a graphical browser I use tor.

I always have JavaScript disabled, unless it's strictly necessary I won't turn
it on. I also don't visit websites that uses Cloudflare, without exception, if
I open a website and it uses Cloudflare it won't let me in and I won't make any
change to visit that site, I will simply get out and look for something similar
somewere else.

I only use a "normal" browser (_Pale moon_) with websites I trust. Actually, I
don't even open any of my websites using that browser, I use tor to see my own
sites.

## Programming languages

I have used a lot of programming languages throughout my life, but I have never
taken one of them seriously, that’s why I barely know something about all of
them.

Past year (2020) I started to take seriously a lot of things, such as hacking
and programming. I will only learn three languages: C, Perl and NASM.

I use PHP, HTML and CSS a bit, I know how to do simple things there but the code
sucks, I used to code a lot on JavaScript but now I don’t like that language.

I’ve never liked Python, C++ or C#. I hate those languages.

## How I learned programming

I discovered programming a long time ago (2013 or so), the first thing I learned
was to do little things in HTML and then I switched to GameMaker. Now I feel
like all the time I spent learning those “languages” were a complete waste of
time.

Still I remember that [this](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=yJcoqOBklK4) was the first
video I ever saw in my life, I downloaded DreamWeaver and started to do the
things that this guy was doing in that video.

Then, I discovered
[this channel](https://yewtu.be/channel/UCLXRGxAzeaLDGaOphqapzmg) and started to
learn CSS (My CSS sucks, I can’t do anything with it, I didn’t learn anything
haha)

And then, I discovered
[this other channel](https://yewtu.be/channel/UCPyrFm1DOHoTwDPv5kQqARg)
and started learning GameMaker.

I kept using GameMaker and some other languages (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL) until
I discovered Linux (my first linux installationg was Debian in August 26th,
2019), from there I discovered and started liking some other languages like C,
Perl and Assembly. Past year (2020) in December I started to take things
seriously and learn C, then I will learn Perl and then I will go for Assembly.

## Non-free software

I won’t run any non-free software on my computer, NO EXCEPTIONS. I hate non-free
software, it disgusts me.

I am so strict with the things that are ran on my computer. I won’t accept any
non-free thing, I always try to convert the audio and video formats on my
computer, I always run LibreJS and I will not enter a website that requires DRM
it will NEVER be activated in any of my browsers.

## Miscellaneous

I will think what to put in this section, and I will update this.
