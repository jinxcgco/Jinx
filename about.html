**Note**: This is based in the way RMS did it on his
[page](https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html).

Before I start writing this, **I don't have a favourite this or that**,
I don't have a favourite anything, that's not how my tastes work, for me, there
are a lot of things that I like and the scale of how much I like them depends on
so many variables, that's why, I can't say that I have a favourite something,
but sometimes it's just easier to make up a list of things that I just remember
so I don't have to explain this to the people every time.

# Music

* Music genres I like are jazz, swing, easy listening, blues, industrial metal,
spanish rap, folk, country, tango and grunge. Singers/groups I like a lot are
Dino, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Perry Como, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong
, Bobby Darin, Nat King, Giulia y Los Tellarini, Bing Crosby, Bob Dylan, Hank
Williams, Johnny Cash, The Irish Rovers, Manuel Medrano, Marilyn Manson, Rob
Zombie, Slipknot, Peggy Lee, Canserbero, El Chojin, Zpu, Billie Holiday, Sara
Vaughan, Nina Simone, Angus and Julia Stone, Liana Malva, JUNG, Nirvana, Ben
Howard, and several others that I can't remember right now.
* I know the lyrics of almost every song I usually listen to, because if I
don't I can't focus, I need to sing while listening to the music (Ironically,
that helps me a lot to get focused).
* I do almost evertything while listening to the music, otherwise I will get
bored so fast (actually, while I am writing this, I am listening to the music).

# Books

* I am almost all the time reading a book.
* Even though I have read a lot and I am always reading something, I am so bad
at recommending books.
* Genres I like the most are romance, mistery, horror, programming, philosophy,
psichology, security/hacking-related books and politics.

# Food

* I am an omnivore.
* I don't like alcohol, it tastes horrible and it makes you stupid.
* I love food but I don't like eating, I think it is a waste of time.

# Religion

* I am an atheist.
* I don't follow any religion.
* I love the LaVeyan philosophy, but when people ask me about my religion I will
not even mention this, as I think people will think I am just seeking for
attention.
* "There's more wisdom on doubt, than infinite knowledge".

# Clothing

* I don't have a "clothing style".
* Actually, I don't care that much about the things I wear on, I simply take the
first clothes I find (if they are clean, obviously) and I put them on.

# Surveillance issues

* See also: [How I do my computing](/about/computing).
* I hate the fact of carrying a phone with me all the time.

# Holidays

* I don't like holidays, I don't like christmas or those new year celebrations.

# Languages

* I speak three languages: Spanish, English and Italian.
* The way I learn new languages is:
  - First, I learn words in that language and try to form simple sentences using
  them.
  - Then, I learn some grammar rules and try to apply them in the sentences I
  wrote beforehand.
  - When I can understand a bit of that language, I will start reading books for
  children, each time I see an unknown word I will take a dictionary, search for
  its definition and try to write down five/seven sentences using that word.
  - Once I feel comfortable using that language, I will start watching videos,
  documentaries and listening to podcasts in that language.
  - Finally, when I feel confident enough using that language, I will look for
  natives to practise it.

# Facts about me

* I completely refuse to consume something from CocaCola, I hate that company.
